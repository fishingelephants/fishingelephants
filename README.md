## Hello WorldðŸ––

I just got back to coding. Never been a real coder or developer before, just hobbyist.

But the recent frustration with no-code and _ahem_ coder(s) as CTO, makes me to give coding another go.

And what's the better time when you've moved to another country with new sets of work piling up to start.
